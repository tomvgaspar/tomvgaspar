# 👋 Hi, I'm Tomás Gaspar [@tomvgaspar]
  > “Always improving.”

I'm a WordPress & WooCommerce specialist focused on building **custom solutions** and continuously improving existing websites 🚀
I work with real production stores (B2B & B2C), so everything I create is driven by **real business needs**, not just demos 🏪

This repository is my personal space to:
- 🧩 Build and evolve a custom WordPress theme  
- 🧪 Experiment with new ideas and features  
- ⚡ Improve performance, UX and scalability  
- 📈 Learn and grow through real projects  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- WordPress  
- WooCommerce  
- PHP  
- JavaScript  
- HTML / CSS

I believe a website is never finished — there's always room to improve 🔁
